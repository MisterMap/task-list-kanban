# Date Handling Implementation - Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing UI integration for date display and handling

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Date parsing and extraction implemented
- [x] Date formatting utilities created
- [x] Test coverage for date utilities
- [x] Status change tracking
- [x] Date preservation during edits
- [ ] UI integration
- [ ] Migration strategy

## Recent Decisions
- Date format standardized as [<description>:: YYYY-MM-DD]
- Sorting priority established: priority > due date > statusChanged
- Tasks without dates will be placed at bottom of columns
- Implemented support for multiple date types: due, statusChanged, created
- Added comprehensive test coverage for date utilities
- Status change date is automatically updated when task moves between columns
- Created dates are preserved and new tasks get current date as created date
- Task content updates preserve all date metadata

## Recent Changes
- Created DateType enum for different date types
- Implemented date parsing and extraction in Task class
- Added date formatting utilities with consistent formatting
- Created getCurrentDate helper for consistent date handling
- Added comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Date parsing and validation
  - Status change tracking
  - Task creation with default dates
  - Date preservation during edits
  - Column movement date updates
- Implemented automatic status change date updates on column changes
- Added date preservation logic during content updates

## Open Questions
- How should we handle date display in the UI?
- What's the best migration strategy for existing tasks?
- Should we add visual indicators for overdue tasks?
- Do we need additional date validation beyond format checking?

## Current Blockers
None at this stage

## Next Implementation Steps
1. Design and implement date display in UI
2. Create migration strategy for existing tasks
3. Add visual indicators for date states
4. Implement UI integration tests

## Notes
- Date parsing and formatting working well with good test coverage
- Status change tracking automatically updates on column changes
- Date metadata is properly preserved during content updates
- New tasks automatically get current date for created and statusChanged
- Need to focus on UI integration and migration strategy next
