# Date Handling Implementation - Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing core date handling functionality and utilities

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Date parsing and extraction implemented
- [x] Date formatting utilities created
- [x] Test coverage for date utilities
- [ ] Status change tracking
- [ ] Sorting implementation
- [ ] UI integration

## Recent Decisions
- Date format standardized as [<description>:: YYYY-MM-DD]
- Sorting priority established: priority > due date > statusChanged
- Tasks without dates will be placed at bottom of columns
- Implemented support for multiple date types: due, statusChanged, created
- Added comprehensive test coverage for date utilities

## Recent Changes
- Created DateType enum for different date types
- Implemented extractDates function to parse dates from task content
- Added formatDate and formatTaskDate utility functions
- Created getCurrentDate helper for consistent date handling
- Added comprehensive test suite for date utilities

## Open Questions
- How should priority be represented in the task data?
- Do we need migration for existing tasks?
- Should we add date validation beyond format checking?

## Current Blockers
None at this stage

## Next Implementation Steps
1. Implement status change tracking logic
2. Create sorting comparator with priority handling
3. Update UI components to display formatted dates
4. Add integration tests

## Notes
- Date parsing and formatting working well with good test coverage
- Need to ensure efficient updates when tracking status changes
- Consider adding date validation beyond format checking
- May need to update the task rendering component
