# Date Handling Implementation - Active Context

## Current Focus
Task completed - All planned functionality implemented and tested

## Implementation Progress
âœ… All features implemented and tested:
- [x] Date parsing and extraction implemented
- [x] Date formatting utilities created
- [x] Test coverage for date utilities
- [x] Status change tracking
- [x] Date preservation during edits
- [x] Sorting functionality implemented
- [x] Integration tests for UI components
  - Date display and formatting
  - Color coding for different date states
  - Date actions through task menu
- [x] Visual indicators for different date states
- [x] Documentation completed

## Final Implementation Details
- Date format standardized as [<description>:: YYYY-MM-DD]
- Sorting priority established: priority > due date > statusChanged
- Tasks without dates placed at bottom of columns
- Support for multiple date types: due, statusChanged, created
- Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
- Status change date automatically updates on column changes
- Created dates preserved and new tasks get current date
- Task content updates preserve all date metadata
- Color coding for due dates:
  - Overdue tasks: red (p0)
  - Due today: yellow (p1)
  - Future tasks: green (p2)

## Completed Features
- DateType enum for different date types
- Date parsing and extraction in Task class
- Date formatting utilities with consistent formatting
- getCurrentDate helper for consistent date handling
- Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Date parsing and validation
  - Status change tracking
  - Task creation with default dates
  - Date preservation during edits
  - Column movement date updates
- Automatic status change date updates on column changes
- Date preservation logic during content updates
- Sorting functionality with priority > due date > status changed
- Handling for tasks without dates
- UI integration with:
  - Date display and formatting
  - Color-coded due date indicators
  - Date manipulation through task menu
- Integration tests verifying all functionality

## Final Notes
- All core functionality implemented and tested
- UI components working as expected with good test coverage
- Date handling system is robust and user-friendly
- Task completed: March 2024

## Open Questions
- Should we add more visual indicators for overdue tasks?
- Do we need additional date validation beyond format checking?
- What kind of date-related UI indicators would be most helpful for users?

## Current Blockers
None at this stage

## Next Implementation Steps
1. Add visual indicators for different date states (overdue, upcoming, etc.)
2. Create and implement migration strategy for existing tasks
3. Document date-related features for users

## Notes
- Date parsing, formatting, and sorting working well with good test coverage
- UI integration tests now verify date display and interaction functionality
