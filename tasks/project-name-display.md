# Project Name Display Enhancement

## Objective
Change project name display in board from full path to file path only to make cards more concise and readable.

## Features
- ✅ Extract and display only the file name from full path
- ✅ Maintain full path in data structure for reference
- ✅ Update UI components to reflect new display format
- ✅ Add a tooltip to show the full path on hover
- ✅ Implement project filtering in "Add new" based on file paths

## Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Modify the task display component to show only the file name
2. ✅ Keep the full path in the task data structure for reference
3. ✅ Update the settings to include an option for file name display format
4. ✅ Add a tooltip to show the full path on hover
5. ✅ Update "Add new" project filtering to use file paths instead of full paths

## Current Status
Completed

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Review current task display implementation
2. ✅ Identify components that need modification
3. ✅ Implement file name extraction logic
4. ✅ Update UI components
5. ✅ Add settings option
6. ✅ Test changes

## Technical Considerations
- ✅ Need to maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Consider edge cases (e.g., files with same name in different folders)
- ✅ Ensure proper tooltip implementation for full path display
